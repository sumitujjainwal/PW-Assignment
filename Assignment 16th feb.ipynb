    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. A database is an organized collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. It can store data in a structured or unstructured format, and can be used to store a wide range of information, such as customer records, financial transactions, and inventory management data. Databases can be broadly classified into two categories: SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases:\n",
    "SQL stands for Structured Query Language, and it is a standardized language used for managing relational databases. SQL databases use a table-based data storage model, in which data is organized into tables with defined columns and rows. SQL databases are known for their strong consistency and the ability to handle complex queries efficiently. Some examples of SQL databases are MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "NoSQL stands for Not Only SQL, and it is a broad category of databases that do not use the traditional table-based data storage model. Instead, NoSQL databases use a variety of data storage models, such as key-value pairs, document-oriented, and graph-based data models. NoSQL databases are known for their high scalability and flexibility. They can handle large amounts of unstructured data and can be easily scaled horizontally across multiple servers. Some examples of NoSQL databases are MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main differences between SQL and NoSQL databases are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Model: SQL databases use a relational data model, while NoSQL databases use a non-relational data model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema: SQL databases have a fixed schema that must be defined before data can be stored, while NoSQL databases have a dynamic schema that allows data to be stored without a predefined structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: NoSQL databases are highly scalable and can handle large amounts of data and high traffic loads, while SQL databases are less scalable and may struggle with large datasets and high traffic loads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Query Language: SQL databases use SQL as their query language, while NoSQL databases may use a variety of query languages, depending on the data model used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistency: SQL databases are known for their strong consistency, while NoSQL databases may sacrifice consistency for scalability and flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both SQL and NoSQL databases have their own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of database depends on the specific use case and requirements of the application.\n",

    "Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. DDL stands for Data Definition Language, which is a subset of SQL commands used to define and manage the structure of database objects, such as tables, indexes, and views. The four main DDL commands are CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE, which are used as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. CREATE: The CREATE command is used to create a new database object, such as a table, view, or index. For example, to create a new table called \"employees\" with columns for employee ID, name, and salary, the following SQL command can be used: \n",
    "CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "    id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    salary DECIMAL(10,2)\n",
    ");\n",
    "DROP: The DROP command is used to remove an existing database object, such as a table, view, or index. For example, to drop the \"employees\" table created above, the following SQL command can be used:\n",
    "DROP TABLE employees;\n",
    "ALTER: The ALTER command is used to modify the structure of an existing database object, such as a table, view, or index. For example, to add a new column for employee age to the \"employees\" table, the following SQL command can be used:\n",
    "ALTER TABLE employees ADD COLUMN age INT;\n",
    "TRUNCATE: The TRUNCATE command is used to remove all data from an existing table, while keeping the table structure intact. For example, to remove all data from the \"employees\" table created above, the following SQL command can be used:\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "These DDL commands are essential for managing the structure and contents of a database, and are used frequently in database administration and application development.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What is DML? Explain INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. DML stands for Data Manipulation Language, which is a subset of SQL commands used to manipulate data within a database. The three main DML commands are INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE, which are used as follows:\n",
    "INSERT: The INSERT command is used to insert new data into a table. For example, to add a new record for an employee with ID 123, name \"John Doe\", and salary $50,000 to the \"employees\" table, the following SQL command can be used:\n",
    "INSERT INTO employees (id, name, salary) VALUES (123, 'John Doe', 50000.00);\n",
    "UPDATE: The UPDATE command is used to modify existing data in a table. For example, to update the salary for employee ID 123 to $60,000 in the \"employees\" table, the following SQL command can be used:\n",
    "UPDATE employees SET salary = 60000.00 WHERE id = 123;\n",
    "DELETE: The DELETE command is used to remove data from a table. For example, to delete the record for employee ID 123 from the \"employees\" table, the following SQL command can be used:\n",
    "DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = 123;\n",
    "These DML commands are essential for manipulating data within a database, and are used frequently in database applications to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on data. It's important to use these commands with caution, as they can have a significant impact on the data within a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What is DQL? Explain SELECT with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. DQL stands for Data Query Language, which is a subset of SQL commands used to retrieve data from a database. The main DQL command is SELECT, which is used to retrieve data from one or more tables based on specified criteria. The SELECT command is commonly used in database applications to retrieve data for reporting, analysis, or other purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how the SELECT command can be used to retrieve data from a table:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a table called \"employees\" that contains information about employees in a company. The table has columns for employee ID, name, department, and salary. To retrieve the names and salaries of all employees in the \"sales\" department, we can use the following SQL command:\n",
    "SELECT name, salary FROM employees WHERE department = 'sales';\n",
    "This command specifies that we want to retrieve the \"name\" and \"salary\" columns from the \"employees\" table, but only for employees where the \"department\" column equals 'sales'. The result of this query would be a table containing the names and salaries of all employees in the \"sales\" department.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SELECT command can also be used with other clauses, such as GROUP BY, ORDER BY, and HAVING, to perform more advanced queries and aggregate data. By using the SELECT command and other DQL commands, developers and analysts can extract meaningful insights from large amounts of data stored in databases.\n",
    "Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. In a relational database, a primary key is a unique identifier for a record in a table. A primary key can be made up of one or more columns, and its values must be unique for each record in the table. Primary keys are used to ensure data integrity and to facilitate efficient data retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a table of customers, the primary key could be a column called \"customer_id.\" Each customer would have a unique customer ID, and this ID would be used to identify the customer in other tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "A foreign key, on the other hand, is a column or set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key of another table. Foreign keys are used to establish relationships between tables, which are crucial in relational database design.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a table of orders, there may be a column called \"customer_id,\" which is a foreign key that refers to the \"customer_id\" column in the customers table. This allows the orders table to be related to the customers table, and allows data to be retrieved across the two tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a primary key is a unique identifier for a record in a table, while a foreign key is a column in one table that refers to the primary key of another table, used to establish relationships between tables in a relational database.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Write a python code to connect MySQL to python. Explain the cursor() and execute() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "import mysql.connector\n",
    "\n",
    "# establish a connection to the MySQL server\n",
    "cnx = mysql.connector.connect(user='abc', password='password',\n",
    "                              host='localhost', database='your_database')\n",
    "\n",
    "# create a cursor object to execute SQL queries\n",
    "cursor = cnx.cursor()\n",
    "\n",
    "# execute a SELECT query\n",
    "query = \"SELECT * FROM your_table\"\n",
    "cursor.execute(query)\n",
    "\n",
    "# fetch the results of the query\n",
    "for row in cursor.fetchall():\n",
    "    print(row)\n",
    "\n",
    "# close the cursor and connection\n",
    "cursor.close()\n",
    "cnx.close()\n",
    "In the code above, we first import the mysql.connector package to use its functions for connecting to MySQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then establish a connection to the MySQL server by passing the required connection parameters, including the username, password, host, and database. This creates a connection object called cnx.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we create a cursor object by calling the cursor() method on the connection object. The cursor object is used to execute SQL queries on the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "We execute a SELECT query by calling the execute() method on the cursor object, passing in the query as a string. The execute() method executes the query and returns the results, which we can fetch using the fetchall() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we close the cursor and connection objects using the close() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cursor() method creates a cursor object that allows us to execute SQL queries on the database. The execute() method is called on the cursor object to execute an SQL query, and it takes the SQL query as a parameter. The execute() method returns the results of the query, which can be fetched using the fetchall() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Give the order of execution of SQL clauses in an SQL query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. The order of execution of SQL clauses in an SQL query is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. FROM: This clause specifies the table or tables from which the data will be selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. WHERE: This clause filters the data based on a specified condition or set of conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. GROUP BY: This clause groups the data based on a specified column or set of columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. HAVING: This clause filters the grouped data based on a specified condition or set of conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. SELECT: This clause selects the columns to be displayed in the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. DISTINCT: This clause eliminates duplicate rows from the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. ORDER BY: This clause sorts the output based on a specified column or set of columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. LIMIT/OFFSET: These clauses limit the number of rows returned by the query or specify the starting point for returning rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that not all of these clauses are required in every SQL query, and the order of execution may vary depending on the specific query. However, this is the general order of execution for a standard SQL query.\n"
