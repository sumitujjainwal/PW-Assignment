    "Q5. Why and When to Use while Loop in Python give a detailed description with example \n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. The while loop in Python is used when you want to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is met. The loop continues to execute as long as the condition is True.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how to use a while loop in Python:\n",
    "count = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "# While loop\n",
    "\n",
    "while count < 5:\n",
    "    print(count)\n",
    "    count += 1\n",
    "0\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "3\n",
    "4\n",
    "In this example, the while loop will continue to execute as long as count is less than 5. The value of count is incremented by 1 after each iteration, so eventually the condition count < 5 will become False, causing the loop to stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to make sure that the condition in a while loop eventually becomes False, otherwise the loop will run forever (an infinite loop), which can cause your program to hang or crash.\n",
